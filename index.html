The subject of class size has always been a point of contention for American society. Everyone wants the absolute best for their child-- the best teachers, the best facilities, the best education. Something that often comes up in this discussion is class size. The common line of thought is that smaller class sizes allows for better learning.

</p>

<p>
When a class is smaller, the teacher can spend more time taking care of each child's individual needs. When looking at the school districts in New York City, there is a staunch discrepancy in class sizes throughout. When looking at the third grade level in two separate districts, the data is clear.

District 5, servicing Morningside Heights, Harlem, and Manhattanville, ranked as one of the lowest in terms of class size. On the other hand, District 24, servicing Long Island City, Ridgewood, and Elmhurst, ranked one of the highest. One of these reasons could be that District 24 is much larger than District 5. More research on the wages of those living in the district might also give some insight. However, the disparity in class size is most definitely something that needs addressing.
